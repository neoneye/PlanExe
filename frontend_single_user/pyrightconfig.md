Pyright setup for `frontend_single_user`
===================================

TL;DR
-----
- Scope: This config is local to `frontend_single_user` and only affects editor analysis, not runtime.
- Key settings: `venvPath: "."`, `venv: ".venv"`, `extraPaths: ["../worker_plan"]` (also in `executionEnvironments`).
- Effect: Fixes editor import resolution for `worker_plan_api.*` without touching code or folder layout.

What Pyright is
---------------
Pyright is a strict static type checker and language server for Python, used by editors like VS Code and Cursor to provide diagnostics, IntelliSense, and import resolution without running the code.

Why this file exists
--------------------
- Cursor/Pyright could not resolve imports like `worker_plan_api.*` when editing `frontend_single_user/app.py`.
- The code lives in `frontend_single_user/`, but `worker_plan_api` lives next door in `../worker_plan`, so the editor needed a path hint.
- Runtime already worked (docker and `.venv`), so this change is purely to align editor analysis with reality.

Why Pyright is the right fix
----------------------------
- Purely analytical: no `sys.path` hacks or code changes just to appease the editor.
- Mirrors actual resolution once `extraPaths` is set, so Cursor matches what runs in docker and `.venv`.
- Scoped and reversible: lives in this folder only and doesn’t affect runtime behavior.

What it does
------------
- Points Pyright at the local virtual environment (`venvPath: "."`, `venv: ".venv"`).
- Adds `../worker_plan` to `extraPaths` (also mirrored inside `executionEnvironments`) so Pyright sees `worker_plan_api`.

Maintenance
-----------
- If you move or rename folders, update `pyrightconfig.json` paths.
- If you switch or rename the interpreter/venv, update `venvPath`/`venv` to match.
- Reload/restart the language server after edits so the changes take effect.
