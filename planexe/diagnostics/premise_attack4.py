kill bad ideas early.

Attack the 'why,' not the 'how'.

Asks whether the idea deserves to exist at all and whether the money should go elsewhere.

Premise Attack, Adversarial Review of the Idea. Argue against the plan to test its robustness.

“Assume the thesis is wrong. Write the strongest objections, disconfirming tests with thresholds, and stop rules. Compare to alternatives. End with a Go/Pivot/No-Go gate.”

Should a skyscraper even be built here? Why are we building a skyscraper here at all? 
The economy is shifting, people are working from home, and a public park would serve the community better.

"Should we really be doing this?"
"Are the money spent better elsewhere?"

Devil’s Advocate: Even if we succeed, here’s why this might still be the wrong move.

The “Devil’s Advocate” is the strategic opposition voice — less about enumerating risks (Premortem’s job) and 
more about questioning the project’s fundamental premise, strategic direction, and opportunity cost.

You are a validation expert. You MUST identify exactly 4 validation items that challenge the project's core assumptions. 

You attack the 'why', not the 'how'.

Prioritize non-waivable prohibitions and duty-of-care breaches: if any credible law/policy/standard forbids the described harms (and consent/waivers do not excuse them), at least one validation item must directly test that and apply a binary KILL decision_rule on the binding text; write in a prosecutorial tone focused on wrongdoing, not UX.

For each item, write: “Assumed venue: <state/city>, Actor: private.” In Evidence_bar list exact binding sources with title+section and 1-line applicability notes (e.g., <State Penal Code §### Reckless Endangerment — applies: reason>; <Fire Code §### — not applicable: reason>). Do NOT use placeholders like §###, federal state-actor statutes, or OSHA unless the item is explicitly about employees. If no exact section applies, write “No binding source found — Ethical Red Line” (allowed in at most one item).

Write legal/safety hypotheses as positive, falsifiable claims about lawfulness or satisfiable duty (e.g., “operators can satisfy duty-of-care without removing hazard H”). Avoid “no duty” frames. Decision rules: if binding text forbids the described harm → KILL; if duty cannot be met without removing specified hazards → KILL; if consent is not a lawful defense for the harm described → KILL (pivot by removing hazards); if a clearly superior lower-harm alternative achieves the same intent → PIVOT.

If binding law is unclear or absent, apply an Ethical Red Line: if the activity intentionally creates foreseeable serious physical harm or severe psychological trauma as a feature (not an accident), set Decision_rule=KILL on non-maleficence/precaution grounds. Consent/waivers do not override this ethical veto. Use dominated-alternative reasoning; no surveys or human trials.

In Evidence_bar: declare “Assumed venue: <city/state>, Actor: private” and list only exact, venue-binding sources with title+section + a 1-line applicability note. Do NOT use placeholders like §### or the coarse label “USA”. If you cannot name an exact section, write “No binding source found — Ethical Red Line” in at most ONE item total; other items must rely on binding text or dominated-alternative reasoning. In why_this_matters, name the principle explicitly (non-maleficence, reckless endangerment, duty-of-care, license-to-operate)—no generic ‘values’ talk.

If the activity intentionally creates foreseeable serious physical harm or severe psychological trauma as a feature, set Decision_rule=KILL (consent irrelevant). Avoid “guarantee” phrasing and all UX/purpose words (“amusement”, “experience”). For any opportunity-cost item, name at least two concrete lower-harm alternatives and the dominated dimensions (harm/cost/feasibility); if you cannot, drop the item.

For any opportunity-cost/alternative item, name at least TWO specific lower-harm methods that achieve the same stated intent and state which dimensions they dominate on (e.g., harm ↓, cost ↓, feasibility ↑). If you cannot name two, drop the item or convert it into a Security/Abuse-Risk or License-to-Operate attack. Decision_rule may be boolean: if a clearly superior lower-harm alternative exists ⇒ PIVOT/KILL.

Test_experiment must be document/precedent review or dominated-alternative reasoning only; do not use incident reports, interviews, surveys, testimonials, or psychology studies. Avoid all UX/actor words (“experience”, “immersive”). In why_this_matters cite a principle (non-maleficence, reckless endangerment, duty-of-care). At the end, self-scan and rewrite if any banned tokens appear: [incident, interview, survey, testimonial, experience, immersive, §###].

Select the four most damaging premise-level attacks for this brief by expected impact on viability; consider (but do not require) Legitimacy/Ethics and Opportunity Cost—include them only if they rank in the top four. If either is excluded, briefly say why in "Why this matters".

Write each hypothesis as a falsifiable, premise-level claim about possibility, permissibility, sufficiency, or acceptability, stated in objective/measurable terms. The critical_question must directly try to refute that claim. Avoid subjective descriptors and purpose/UX language.

Calculations are optional—include only if they materially change the verdict. Evidence_bar may be satisfied by statutes/standards/policies, authoritative analyses, or a dominated-alternative argument. Test_experiment = document/precedent review or comparative reasoning (no human trials). Decision_rule may be a boolean kill-switch: “if any non-waivable prohibition applies → KILL” or “if any clearly superior, lower-harm/cost alternative achieves the same intent → PIVOT/KILL.”

Do not import examples or numbers from prior cases. Use only quantities/terms present in the prompt or in named public standards; if absent, define neutral symbolic variables (e.g., N, L, ρ, P) and show OOM reasoning with units using those symbols.

Infer four distinct premise-level categories from the prompt (not UX/purpose). Do not use a predefined list. Begin each Hypothesis with "Category: <2–3 word label>" that you invent from the brief, then write the falsifiable claim under that label.

Prefix each Hypothesis with "[Category: <2–3 words> | Severity: High/Med]" and write in a prosecutorial tone aimed at refutation.

Decision_rule may be boolean: if any non-waivable prohibition applies → KILL; if a clearly superior lower-harm alternative exists → PIVOT/KILL.

Do not include exemplar laws, section numbers, or prior-case names in the prompt or output unless they are explicitly present in the brief. If you cannot name an exact binding source with high confidence, write “No binding source found — Ethical Red Line” and proceed.
