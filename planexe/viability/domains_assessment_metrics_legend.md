### Legend: How to Read the Scores

The viability of each pillar is rated on a 1â€“5 scale across three key metrics. Higher scores are better.

| Metric | Strong Negative (1) | Weak Negative (2) | Neutral (3) | Weak Positive (4) | Strong Positive (5) |
|--------|--------------------|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Evidence** | No/contradictory evidence; claims only | Anecdotes/unstable drafts | Inconclusive; limited data | Internal tests/pilot support | Independent, reproducible validation; monitored |
| **Risk** | Severe exposure; blockers/unknowns | Major exposure; mitigations not in place | Moderate; mitigations planned/in progress | Low residual risk; mitigations in place | Minimal residual risk; contingencies tested |
| **Fit** | Conflicts with constraints/strategy | Low alignment; major trade-offs | Mixed/unclear alignment | Good alignment; minor trade-offs | Strong alignment; directly reinforces strategy |
