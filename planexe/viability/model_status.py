    This enum represents the overall viability status of a project or plan
    based on evidence and assessment of critical factors.
    
    Attributes:
        GREEN: Good to go. You have solid evidence and no open critical 
               unknowns. Proceed. Any remaining tasks are minor polish.
        YELLOW: Viable, but risks/unknowns exist. There's promise, but you're 
                missing proof on key points or see non-fatal risks. Proceed 
                with caution and a focused checklist.
        RED: Not viable right now. There's a concrete blocker or negative 
             evidence (legal, technical, economic) that stops execution until 
             fixed. Pause or pivot.
        GRAY: Unknown / unassessed. You don't have enough information to judge. 
              Don't guessâ€”add a "first measurement" task to get out of uncertainty.
