"""
Go through a checklist, to determine if there are problems with the plan.

The Primary Reader (The "Go/No-Go" Decision-Maker): This is a senior executive, a project sponsor, or even a political figure (like a Chief of Staff) who commissioned this report.

    Value: This section is the most valuable part of the entire report for this reader. They may not have the time or expertise to read the full 100+ page plan. This checklist provides an immediate, at-a-glance diagnostic. The overwhelming number of 🛑 High risk items sends an unambiguous message: "This plan, in its current form, is fundamentally non-viable and dangerous." It's a powerful visual tool for communicating extreme risk without needing to parse complex paragraphs.

The Secondary Reader (The Project Manager/Lead): This is the person tasked with potentially fixing the plan.

    Value: It serves as a prioritized "fix-it" list. It tells the project manager which fires are the biggest. They don't need to worry about the team size (a ⚠️ Medium risk) if the entire project is a 🛑 High "Legal Minefield." It focuses their attention on the foundational, existential threats to the project's success.

Calibation. Skewed distribution: 16 “High” flags out of 20 reads like alarm fatigue. 
Yes, the majority may be red. Holding the items up against each other is not the job for this checklist. It's further downstream.
I'm not going to reserve High for the most significant issues.
The primary task with this checklist is to detect that there is something fundamentally wrong with the plan.

Some of the checklist items overlaps with each other, and I don't care about things being mutually exclusive where things are not supposed to overlap.
I care about what problems I observe in the generated reports.

If this is a first-of-its-kind or unregulated/novel construct, set level to 'high'. In the justification, cite the exact areas with no precedent (markets, technology, policy) rather than saying 'missing referenced artifacts'.

If funding sources are mentioned, note whether they are confirmed or speculative. In the justification, cite the specific lack of figures or the uncommitted nature of funding.

Set LEVEL to HIGH if the plan presents key projections (e.g., revenue, user adoption, completion dates) as a single number without providing a range, confidence interval, or discussing alternative scenarios (e.g., a 'worst-case' or 'conservative' case). The lack of contingency planning for projections indicates optimism. For mitigation, require a sensitivity analysis or a best/worst/base-case scenario analysis for the most critical projection.

Set LEVEL to HIGH if a major deliverable is mentioned without specific, verifiable qualities. For justification, name the abstract deliverable. The mitigation must be a task to define SMART acceptance criteria for that deliverable, including at least one specific, quantifiable Key Performance Indicator (KPI).

Set level to 'high' if this role is both essential and likely difficult to fill. The justification must name this unicorn role and explain why its expertise is both critical and rare. The mitigation must be a task to validate the talent market for that specific role as an early go/no-go check. Provide ≤30‑word justification and a mitigation with Owner, Deliverable, and Date.",
        "comment": "For a 'Im a solo entrepreneur and is making everything myself' prompt, then the generated plan is likely suggesting to hire a huge team of people, and ignoring the fact that the entrepreneur is doing everything themselves.

(2) Maintenance requirements—are specialized skills, parts, or vendors needed that may not be available long-term? (3) Scalability—can the system handle growth or changing conditions? (4) Personnel dependency—does operation depend on specific individuals who may leave? (5) Technology obsolescence—will critical technology become unsupported or obsolete? (6) Environmental/social impact—can negative impacts be managed long-term? Set LEVEL to HIGH if: operational costs exceed sustainable funding, maintenance requires unavailable resources, or the system cannot adapt to changing conditions. Set LEVEL to MEDIUM if: sustainability concerns exist but can be addressed with planning. Set LEVEL to LOW if: a clear, sustainable operational model exists with adequate resources.

You are an expert strategic analyst. Your task is to answer a checklist with red flags.
You will output only valid JSON. No explanations, no chit-chat, no Markdown, no code fences.

GOAL
Return exactly one object per checklist item with keys in this order: level, justification, mitigation.

RUBRIC
- "low": strong evidence or controls in the plan address the risk; only minor follow-up remains.
- "medium": partial coverage exists but material gaps or untested assumptions remain that could cause issues.
- "high": critical controls, evidence, or commitments are missing or implausible, creating a likely or existential failure mode.

STRICT RULES
- Answer only for checklist entries whose status is "TODO"; treat "IGNORE" items as read-only context and never output them.
- level must be one of: "low", "medium", "high".
- Start each justification with "Rated LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH because..." (use the chosen level) so the reader sees how the rubric was applied.
- justification: include 1–2 short verbatim quotes from the plan that justify the level. When the plan omits the necessary evidence entirely, explicitly describe the missing artifact/control and explain why that absence meets the rubric instead of inventing quotes.
- justification must quote only from the plan text, and when citing gaps, refer to the absence plainly without using placeholder phrases.
- Never use the phrase "missing referenced artifacts" or similar placeholders; spell out what evidence is missing and the consequence.
- mitigation: ONE assignable task. Start with a suggested role/team, followed by a verb, and include a suggested timeframe (e.g., "Legal Team: Draft a memo... within 30 days."). ~30 words.
- mitigation must be actionable; never respond with "N/A" or similar placeholders.
- Mitigation must be specific to the identified issue; avoid vague directives like "review the plan", "consult experts", or "investigate" unless paired with a concrete deliverable that directly reduces the flagged risk.
- If the level is "low", mitigation should reinforce existing good practice (e.g., document evidence, schedule routine monitoring) rather than delegating a broad re-check of the entire plan.
- If information is genuinely missing, name the missing evidence explicitly, choose level "medium" or "high", and craft mitigation that acquires or validates that evidence.
