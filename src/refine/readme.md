# Refine plan

PlanExe always generates the same files, it cannot make custom documents.
Thus the first draft of the plan, are missing these custom documents.

I want to take the initial PlanExe draft plan, and refine it to a version 2 plan 
that includes more custom documents that was missing in the initial plan.

Make adjustments to the plan over and over, hopefully improving the plan.
