"""
Cycle through multiple LLMs, if one fails, try the next one.

I want all LLM invocations to go through this class.

It happens that the json output of the LLM doesn't match the expected schema.
When I inspect the raw response, I can see that the json comes close to the expected schema,
with tiny mistakes here and there. I guess with a more fuzzy json parser than Pydantic, 
the json could be extracted.

It happens that an LLM provider is unavailable. Where a model used to be available, and have been removed from the provider.
Or the LLM server has to be started by the developer on the local machine.

Having multiple LLMs available is a good idea, because it increases the chances of success.
If one fails, then the next one may be able to respond.
If all of them fails, then the exception is raised. Exhausted all LLMs.

This is the class that `PlanTask` is using, the root class of all tasks in the pipeline.
Subtasks such as `ReviewPlan` are also using this class to invoke the LLM.

IDEA: Scheduling strategy: randomize the order of LLMs.
IDEA: Scheduling strategy: cycle through the LLM list twice, so there are two chances to succeed.
IDEA: Measure the number of tokens used by each LLM.
IDEA: Measure the duration of each LLM.
IDEA: Measure the number of times each LLM was used.
IDEA: Measure the number of times each LLM failed. Is there a common reason for failure.
IDEA: track stats about token usage
IDEA: track what LLM was succeeded
IDEA: track if the LLM failed and why
