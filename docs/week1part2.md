/**
 * Author: Cascade 
 * Date: 2025-09-19T16:59:36-04:00
 * PURPOSE: Break down the remaining Week 1 NextJS tasks into manageable phases for systematic development
 * SRP and DRY check: Pass - This document focuses solely on task organization and respects existing architecture

## 🎯 **Phase Breakdown for Week 1 Part 2**

### **Phase 1: Complete API Foundation (Days 1-2)**
**Priority: Critical** - Core infrastructure needs to be solid

#### **Phase 1A: Finish API Routes**
- [ ] Complete `/api/plans/route.ts` - Plan creation endpoint
- [ ] Complete `/api/plans/[planId]/route.ts` - Plan status/details
- [ ] Complete `/api/plans/[planId]/progress/route.ts` - Real-time progress
- [ ] Add `/api/plans/[planId]/files/route.ts` - File listing
- [ ] Add `/api/plans/[planId]/download/route.ts` - File downloads

#### **Phase 1B: Configuration Routes** 
- [ ] Create `/api/config/llms/route.ts` - Available LLM models from llm_config.json
- [ ] Create `/api/config/prompts/route.ts` - Prompt catalog from existing system
- [ ] Add `/api/session/route.ts` - Session management endpoints

**Deliverable**: Complete API proxy layer that interfaces with existing Python backend

### **Phase 2: Core UI Components (Days 3-4)**
**Priority: High** - User interface foundation

#### **Phase 2A: Planning Interface**
- [ ] Build `PlanForm.tsx` - Main plan creation form
- [ ] Build `ModelSelector.tsx` - LLM model selection dropdown
- [ ] Build `SpeedSelector.tsx` - Speed vs detail radio buttons  
- [ ] Build `PromptExamples.tsx` - Prompt catalog integration
- [ ] Build `ApiKeyInput.tsx` - OpenRouter API key handling

#### **Phase 2B: Monitoring Interface**
- [ ] Build `ProgressMonitor.tsx` - Real-time pipeline progress display
- [ ] Build `StatusDisplay.tsx` - Current pipeline status indicator
- [ ] Build `FileList.tsx` - Live file listing with pipeline stages
- [ ] Build `ErrorDisplay.tsx` - Error handling and user feedback

**Deliverable**: Functional planning and monitoring UI components

### **Phase 3: File Management & State (Days 5-6)**
**Priority: High** - Core functionality completion

#### **Phase 3A: File Operations**
- [ ] Build `FileManager.tsx` - File browser with FilenameEnum support
- [ ] Build `DownloadButton.tsx` - Individual file downloads
- [ ] Build `ZipDownload.tsx` - Complete plan archive download
- [ ] Implement file type detection and icons

#### **Phase 3B: State Management**
- [ ] Create Zustand stores (`session.ts`, `planning.ts`, `config.ts`)
- [ ] Implement session persistence with localStorage
- [ ] Add plan history tracking
- [ ] Create configuration caching system

**Deliverable**: Complete file management and persistent state system

### **Phase 4: Integration & Testing (Day 7)**
**Priority: Critical** - Ensure everything works end-to-end

#### **Phase 4A: Luigi Pipeline Integration**
- [ ] Test pipeline creation with real Luigi subprocess
- [ ] Verify progress tracking matches actual file creation
- [ ] Test pipeline stopping/resuming functionality
- [ ] Validate all FilenameEnum output patterns work

#### **Phase 4B: Quality Assurance**
- [ ] End-to-end testing: form → pipeline → results
- [ ] Error handling testing (failed pipelines, missing files)
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple concurrent plans
- [ ] Browser compatibility testing

**Deliverable**: Fully functional NextJS app with complete Gradio feature parity

## 🛠 **Implementation Strategy**

### **Incremental Development Approach**
1. **Build piece by piece** - Don't try to create everything at once
2. **Test frequently** - Test each component with the actual Luigi pipeline
3. **Respect existing architecture** - Never modify the Luigi pipeline files
4. **Focus on functionality first** - Polish and styling come after core features work

### **Risk Mitigation**
1. **Luigi Integration Risk**: Test API routes with actual pipeline early and often
2. **File System Risk**: Validate FilenameEnum patterns match exactly what Luigi creates
3. **Performance Risk**: Monitor memory usage during long pipeline runs
4. **State Management Risk**: Test session persistence across browser restarts

### **Success Criteria for Each Phase**
- **Phase 1**: API routes successfully proxy to Python backend
- **Phase 2**: UI components render and capture user input correctly  
- **Phase 3**: Files can be browsed and downloaded, state persists
- **Phase 4**: Complete end-to-end Luigi pipeline execution works

## 📋 **Immediate Next Steps**

1. **Examine existing API routes** in `planexe-frontend/src/app/api/` to understand what's already built
2. **Identify gaps** in the current API implementation
3. **Create missing TypeScript interfaces** for data structures
4. **Complete Phase 1A** by finishing the core API routes
5. **Test each API route** with the existing Python backend
