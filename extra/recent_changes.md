# Recent Changes in PlanExe

## 2025-dec-31

PlanExe is now using Docker.

So you no longer have to be python developer to install it on your own computer.

Over the last month I have migrated PlanExe to [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

So that I can deploy PlanExe on [Railway](https://railway.com/) and similar web providers.

Previously I have been using PythonAnywhere, and I was stuck in a dependency hell, where I couldn't add packages without breaking other packages.

Now with docker, I don't have these incompatibility issues.
However docker have its own issues.

The last version BEFORE the transition to docker is available here
https://github.com/neoneye/PlanExe/releases/tag/2025-dec-31

The main branch will be docker from now on.
